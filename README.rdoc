== Feedalgo

Feedalgo is a simple yet functional RSS Reader. The main acheivment of this project is to replace the now dead Google Reader.
It's basically a Google Reader clone, and there are't many fancy features planned, but I'm open to new requests.

== Features

It, of course, can import and read feeds. You can group your feeds using folders.
It's multi-user, so many users can use it all at once and you can also import OPML from other services.

== License

It's relased under MIT
